# NHS Mayden Project
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of NHS talking therapies data aimed at improving patient care through data-driven insights. We utilized various data science techniques and supervised learning algorithms to uncover significant correlations and metrics.

# Repository Structure
data_processing/: Scripts for cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.
correlation_calculators/: Tools and scripts used to calculate and analyze correlations between different variables in the dataset.
learning_algorithms/: Implementation of supervised learning algorithms including Decision Trees and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to predict and interpret patient outcomes.
autocorrelation/: Analysis and visualization of autocorrelation within the dataset to understand temporal dependencies and patterns.

# Data Privacy
Please note that the original dataset used in this project has been removed due to patient privacy. The repository contains only the code and documentation necessary to reproduce the analysis with a suitable dataset.
